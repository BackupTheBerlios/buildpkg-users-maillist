Subject: [Buildpkg-users] News Update

If anyone is reading this, here we go:

With Slackware 11.0 reaching the state of RC1, I have decided it's
time to get working for real.

As of today, I will no longer be following the official Slackware
updates for my home and development systems. I will see the updates,
but add them to buildpkg instead.

In parallel, Jantin Linux development will follow the updates added to buildpkg.

I have the intention to release at least an official beta before the
end of 2006, but things can change.
